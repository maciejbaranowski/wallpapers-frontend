# TODO

## Front-end part

* Add meta tags in index.html
* Add some content for SEO
* Replace title tag when changing site

## Back-end part

## Content preparation

* Prepare local version for quick voting (go to next after vote in FullImage view)
* Go through all wallpapers and vote them. Then delete those that have little to no value (task for Ola?)
* Run modified script to get higher-res wallpapers _ 1 - vote for wallpapers that have overflowing text, are unreadable
	or are somehow wrong _ 2 - vote for completely uninteresting quotes, or are extremely long \* 3,4,5 - vote for quotes
	depending on how quote is interesting, and how related is background to quote

## Marketing

* Update facebook profile

## Bugs

* Categories are sometimes displayes by id rather than human-readable form
